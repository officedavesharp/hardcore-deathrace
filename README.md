## Features

**Timer System**: Each level has a time limit - race against the clock to level up before time runs out. Time limits increase as you progress: 30 minutes for levels 1-10, 1 hour for 11-20, 2 hours for 21-30, 4 hours for 31-40, 6 hours for 41-50, and 8 hours for 51-60.

**Progressive Screen Darkening**: As your timer runs low, your screen progressively darkens with tunnel vision effects. The darker it gets, the less time you have remaining.

**Time Rollover**: Unused time from your current level carries over when you level up, giving you a buffer for tougher levels ahead.

**Rested Area Pause**: The timer automatically pauses when you're in rested areas, allowing you to plan your next moves without pressure.

**Statistics Panel**: Track your current level, failure timer, and total score (time played) in a movable on-screen panel with color-coded warnings.

**Achievement Integration**: Completing achievements from the HardcoreAchievements addon grants you a 1-hour time bonus, rewarding exploration and completion.

**Failure & Win Screens**: If your timer runs out, you'll see a failure screen with your final score. Reach level 60 in time to see the victory screen!

**Anti-Cheat Protection**: Built-in XP tracking prevents cheating by detecting if the addon was disabled to gain unfair advantages.

**Color-Coded Timer**: The failure timer changes color based on remaining time - green when safe, yellow when warning, red when critical.
