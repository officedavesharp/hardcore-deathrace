## Features

**Timer System**: Each level has a time limit - race against the clock to level up before time runs out. Time limits increase as you progress towards 60.

**Progressive Screen Darkening**: As your timer runs low, your screen progressively darkens with tunnel vision effects. The darker it gets, the less time you have remaining.

**Time Rollover**: Unused time from your current level carries over when you level up, giving you a buffer for tougher levels ahead.

**Rested Area Pause**: The timer automatically pauses when you're in rested areas, allowing you to plan your next moves without pressure.

**Bonus Time**: Completing achievements from the Hardcore Achievements by Chills companion addon, or levelling up professions grants bonus time.

## FAQ

**How to get more time?**

There are several ways to gain additional time:
- **Time Rollover**: Unused time from your current level automatically carries over when you level up, giving you a buffer for tougher levels ahead.
- **Achievements**: Completing achievements from the Hardcore Achievements by Chills companion addon grants bonus time.
- **Professions**: Leveling up your professions grants bonus time, making them a valuable investment.
- **Rested Areas**: The timer automatically pauses when you're in rested areas, effectively giving you more time to plan your next moves.

**How much time is granted per level? Is it linear or bracketed?**

Time allocation uses a bracketed system, meaning levels are grouped into ranges with the same time limit. For example, levels 1-5 each grant 10 minutes, levels 6-10 grant 20 minutes each, levels 11-15 grant 45 minutes each, and so on. These time brackets will be tweaked with player feedback to ensure the requirements are challenging but fair.

**Is there anywhere where time doesn't pass?**

Yes! The timer automatically pauses when you're in rested areas (inns, cities, as well as flight paths). This allows you to take a break, plan your route, manage your inventory, travel, or strategize without losing precious time.

**Does playing with others bring an extra challenge?**

While grouping provides safety and shared experience, the timer continues regardless of whether you're solo or grouped, so you'll need to balance the safety benefits of grouping against the time pressure of the race.

**Is it worth doing a profession?**

Absolutely! Leveling professions grants bonus time, making them a strategic investment rather than just a time sink. The bonus time you earn can help offset the time spent gathering materials and crafting, and can provide crucial buffer time for difficult levels ahead. Time spent work on professions in rested areas where the timer is paused can be extremely worthwhile.
