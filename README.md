## Features

**Timer System**: Each level has a time limit - race against the clock to level up before time runs out. Time limits increase as you progress towards 60.

**Progressive Screen Darkening**: As your timer runs low, your screen progressively darkens with tunnel vision effects. The darker it gets, the less time you have remaining.

**Time Rollover**: Unused time from your current level carries over when you level up, giving you a buffer for tougher levels ahead.

**Rested Area Pause**: The timer automatically pauses when you're in rested areas, allowing you to plan your next moves without pressure.

**Bonus Time**: Completing achievements from the Hardcore Achievements by Chills companion addon, or levelling up professions grants bonus time.

1. Download the latest release of Hardcore Deathrace from CurseForge.
2. Extract the addon to your World of Warcraft `Interface/AddOns` folder.
